# Custom Lily58 Firmware (ZMK)
Firmware for my custom Lily58 build.

Features:
- Bluetooth
- NiceNanoV2 controllers
- 56 keys
- 2 EC11 rotary encoders
- Custom keymap for efficient coding

## TO DO
- Fix right EC11, stock firmware does not support this, currently only push button works on right (see branch right-side-EC11)
- Can the EC11s be context dependant? (I want to change brush size in an editor, but scroll in a browser, etc)
